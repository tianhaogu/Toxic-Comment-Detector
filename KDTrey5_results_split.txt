Kevin, What are your thoughts about not winning a chip by yourself? I mean, nothing without Steph Curry. You blowed out a 3-1 lead against him, and then you had to join him for winning... I will wait for your answer Kevin!

@KDTrey5 KD still won more playoff games than you that 2015-2016 season You should thank your team for going 5-2 without you in the playoffs. Unlike KD, his team went 4-12 without him, while recruiting Dipo, Melo, and Paul George No surprised Steph won this very uneven matchup. https://t.co/tdGiIMeJeO

I think the NBA has their own private officiating system. The fact that the Mavs were up 36-13 in the first quarter was probably a big part of the no-call. The NBA doesn't like blowouts and starts officiating teams differently when the point spread gets too wide early.

He was FOULED 3times. Time for these refs to be suspended without pay and/or fired. Also, that you only get 1-challenge rule is a Fuhkin FARCE. Refs make HORRIBLE calls 5-10 times a game each team and you can ONLY get one call changed. Double tech is BS too. FACTSüíØ
